Weekend Challenge **weekend-jquery-server-calculator** from Prime Academy

## Description

*What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?*

In this weekend challenge, I developed a server-side calculator with a user interface allowing users to input two values, select a mathematical operation, and submit the calculation through a POST request to the server. The server, handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. A 'Clear' button was implemented to clear the user input fields. The server maintains a historical record of all calculations and solutions, which is displayed on the page upon loading using a GET request. The implementation solved the challenge of server-side computation, providing real-time feedback and a history log.
